## Notes and next steps
- I created this inventory at: `Designs/Sypot_Designs_List.md`.
- Next: I can (choose one):
  - Extract asset file lists (image names and types) per screen.
  - Copy the final folders into a `Designs/Final` folder.
  - Produce a flattened checklist CSV/JSON for PM handoff.

Tell me which next step you'd like, or ask me to refine the markdown further.
